Greene\nAssistant Professor, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Villanova University\nMy research focuses on how people remember past experience, with a particular emphasis on the precision or quality of what people remember or, conversely, what they forget. This research seeks to identify mechanisms underlying why our episodic memories are often fuzzy, especially as we age into older adulthood. To address these questions, I combine behavioral experimentation with computational modeling to study memory across different timescales and levels of representation."

    "text": "What we do\nWe study how people learn and later remember information. We are particularly interested in the quality of people’s memories: what details are preserved, and what causes others to be forgotten? Answering these questions requires making inferences about things we cannot observe directly – other people’s memories. By combining behavioral experiments with mathematical and computational models, we aim to build a clearer picture of the dynamics of human memory.\nExplore our research\nSee publications"
