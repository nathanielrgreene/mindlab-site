# Memory INFerences & Dynamics (MIND) Lab

We study how people build, use, and sometimes mis-use memory—especially when remembering requires **inference**, **attention**, and **time**.

## What we’re trying to understand

::: {.questions}
- **When does memory preserve detail—and when does it collapse into gist?**
- **How does attention shape what gets stored vs. what gets filled in later?**
- **Why do confident memories sometimes contain the wrong specifics?**
- **How do retrieval dynamics change what we ultimately report as “remembered”?**

## Our work combines

::: {.cards}
::: {.card}
### Behavioral experiments
Carefully controlled tasks measuring accuracy, confidence, and response dynamics.
:::

::: {.card}
### Computational modeling
Formal models that make explicit predictions about *how* memory evolves and is retrieved.
:::

::: {.card}
### Lifespan & individual differences
How memory precision, inference, and strategy vary across people and age.
