## What we do

We study how people learn and later remember information. We are particularly interested in the *quality* of people's memories: what details are preserved, and what causes others to be forgotten? Answering these questions requires making **inferences** about things we cannot observe directly -- other people's memories. By combining behavioral experiments with mathematical and computational models, we aim to build a clearer picture of the **dynamics** of human memory.

## What we’re trying to understand

- When does memory preserve detail — and when does it collapse into gist?  
- How does attention shape what gets stored vs. what gets filled in later?  
- Why do confident memories sometimes contain the wrong specifics?  
- How do memory representations change across time and across the lifespan?
